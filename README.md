# About Parallel Drive

Creative technology for thinking machines.

Parallel Drive is a software engineering lab redefining how products are built in the AI age. We offer software engineering as a service: one monthly fee buys you development capacity with battle tested processes and cutting edge AI Driven Development powered by our open source agent frameworks.

We serve startups and builders ready to bring their products to market, merging proven engineering discipline with AI native workflows that deliver unprecedented productivity and quality. While others struggle with AI slop, we've developed agentic systems that enhance every step of the development process. Led by the engineering manager who built Adobe Firefly, we transform your ideas into intelligent products that learn, adapt, and inspire, with clarity, integrity, and technical excellence.

## How We Work

A little time pressure is good for delivery times. But inaccurate estimates are very bad for quality.

[Jørgensen and Sjøberg (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584901002038) found a significant increase in defects introduced when programmers were given a schedule that was estimated incorrectly.

Our approach is to offer biweekly demos, creating pressure to ship improvements and deliver impressive work at a steady pace, without the risk of estimates. Software estimates are often wrong by a factor of 4x or more—[research by Boehm (1981)](https://archive.org/details/softwareengineer0000boeh) found that at the initial concept stage, estimates can vary by a factor of 4x in either direction. [Studies show 70-80% of projects overrun estimates by 30-40% on average](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584912000511), while [time pressure causes developers to cut corners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.04374), accumulating technical debt. By skipping the estimation step and using demos to create time pressure instead, we improve trust, transparency, and accountability without ever cutting corners or increasing defect rates.


## Open Source Projects

Parallel Drive actively maintains and contributes to several widely used open-source libraries and frameworks that empower developers worldwide:

### 🔹 [AIDD Framework](https://github.com/paralleldrive/aidd)
A modular toolkit for building AI-Driven Development workflows, integrating intelligent agents, RAG pipelines, and adaptive learning loops into modern software systems.

### 🔹 [cuid2](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2)
A collision-resistant, human-readable identifier library designed for distributed systems.  
Simple, fast, and trusted by major platforms to generate secure, unique IDs at scale.

### 🔹 [Riteway](https://github.com/paralleldrive/riteway)
A minimal, opinionated testing framework for JavaScript that emphasizes readability, correctness, and reproducibility.  
Designed to help developers write tests that clearly express intent.

### 🔹 [SudoLang Specification & VS Code Extension](https://github.com/paralleldrive/sudolang)
SudoLang is a constraint-based, interface-oriented pseudocode language for reasoning with large language models.  
The accompanying VS Code extension adds syntax highlighting, snippets, and autocompletion to accelerate AI-assisted programming.
