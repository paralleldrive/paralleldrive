# Sales Partner Outreach Messaging

Hi,

I am looking for independent sales operators who prefer upside over salary.

I pay 5% of booked revenue for the first 6 months. Typical deals generate $16k to $60k in commission, targeting scaling tech startups and enterprise teams.

No cap. No draw. No exclusivity.
You own your process. I handle delivery.

If you already sell high ticket B2B and want a clean commission only partnership with real economics, book a meeting at paralleldrive.com

Eric
